            <h2>Decoding the Crisis: A Closer Look at Drug Shortages</h2>
            <p>Drug shortages are characterized by the insufficient availability of certain medications in the 
                market. These shortages can result from various factors, including manufacturing issues, 
                regulatory challenges, supply chain disruptions, and increased demand. Patients relying on 
                medications for chronic conditions or life-threatening illnesses often bear the brunt of these 
                shortages, as access to crucial treatments becomes uncertain. Especially in recent months, the 
                country has experienced numerous shortages of Adderall, Ozempic, Albuterol, and even chemotherapy 
                drugs.</p>

            <h2>The Ripple Effect: How Drug Shortages Impact Patients and Providers</h2>
            <p>Patients facing drug shortages encounter significant difficulties in obtaining the medications 
                they need. This can lead to delayed or interrupted treatments, compromised health outcomes, and 
                increased healthcare costs. Healthcare providers also grapple with the consequences, as they must 
                navigate alternative treatment options, spend additional time coordinating patient care, and cope 
                with the ethical dilemmas posed by limited resources.</p>

            <p>Stay proactive in managing prescriptions, ensuring timely refills, and discussing potential 
                substitutions with healthcare providers if needed.</p>
            <h3>3. Patient Assistance Programs:</h3>
            <p>Explore patient assistance programs offered by pharmaceutical companies or nonprofit organizations, 
                which may provide access to medications at reduced costs or free of charge.</p>
            <h3>4. Pharmacist Consultation:</h3>
            <p>Consult with pharmacists, who possess extensive knowledge of medications and may offer insights on 
                alternative options or availability.</p>
