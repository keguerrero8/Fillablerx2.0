            <h3>KOW is an Online Referral Service and Prescription Management Platform</h3>
            <p>KOW enables You, the Patient and/or Provider, to locate one (1) or more of Your prescription
                medication needs by submitting a request for Your medication through our Site, (“Request”) and
                acts as a prescription locator only. After submitting a Request, the Services reach out to KOW’s
                network of pharmacies, (each an “Enrolled Pharmacy”, and collectively the “Enrolled
                Pharmacies”), to identity which of the Enrolled Pharmacies carry the Requested Medication, as
                hereinafter defined, in stock in order to refer You to that Enrolled Pharmacy. Each medication
                that You request through KOW must be based on a valid prescription issued for a legitimate
                medical purpose by a medical professional acting in the usual course of his/her professional
                practice. You understand that submitting a query for the Requested Medication only identifies
                and locates an Enrolled Pharmacy which carries the Requested Medication. Following KOW’s
                referral, You understand that it is solely Your responsibility to ensure that the Enrolled Pharmacy
                receives Your prescription, which it will then dispense accordingly. KOW in no way guarantees
                that the Requested Medication will be prepared and ready for pickup by You. The Services are
                not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment and shall not be used as 
                such. Additionally, the Services do not constitute medical or other professional advice. For the
                avoidance of doubt, KOW is not a pharmacy and is not giving You any medical advice
                whatsoever. KOW does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, products,
                procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Services or by any
                other electronic means. Reliance on any information provided by KOW is solely at Your own
                risk and is disseminated strictly for informational purposes. The information provided through
                KOW’s Services is designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between
                patient/site-visitor and his/her physician. Never disregard professional medical or pharmaceutical
                advice or delay in seeking it because of something You have read or seen on our Services. In the
                event of any medical emergency, please cease using the Services and immediately dial 9-1-1 and
                seek the assistance of a medical professional.</p>
            <h3>KOW Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Please refer to our {<Link className='link-privacy' to="/privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy </Link>} for information on how we collect, use and disclose
                information from our users. By using our Services and clicking below, You are accepting the
                Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>
            <h3>Order Fulfillment by Pharmacy</h3>
            <p>When You, the Patient and/or Provider, submit a Request through KOW, we transmit Your
                Request to KOW’s network of Enrolled Pharmacies to enable You to ascertain the availability of
                requested, prescribed medication in the amounts and dosages stated on Your valid prescription
                (“Requested Medication”). Please note that You must have a valid, legal prescription for the
                Requested Medication that a licensed medical professional has provided to You. By utilizing the
                Services, You are submitting a Request that is transmitted to the Enrolled Pharmacies to
                determine if any of the Enrolled Pharmacies possess the Requested Medication in their
                inventory. If an Enrolled Pharmacy has the Requested Medication in stock at the time of Your
                inquiry, You will be immediately notified via SMS text messaging: (i) which Enrolled Pharmacy
                can fill Your prescription, if any; (ii) the location of the Enrolled Pharmacy; and (iii) the time
                Your Requested Medication will be ready for pick up, after which You can pick it up. However,
                You acknowledge and agree that KOW does not guarantee that Your Requested Medication will
                be ready for pickup at the Enrolled Pharmacy. You understand and agree that it is Your
                responsibility to ensure that the Enrolled Pharmacy has received Your valid prescription to
                subsequently dispense to You, after you have submitted Your request for the Requested
                Medication through our Services.</p>
            <p>Again, You acknowledge and agree that KOW is not a pharmacy nor do we provide any medical
                advice whatsoever. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not fill prescriptions
                ourselves, nor do we manufacture, prepare, dispense or provide medications of any kind. You
                also acknowledge and agree that, although we may select certain pharmacies to work with based
                on various metrics we apply, our decision to work with a specific pharmacy should not be
                deemed an endorsement of, or a warranty regarding the quality of services provided by, such
                Enrolled Pharmacy. If, for any reason, You are not satisfied with the manner in which the 
                Enrolled Pharmacy processed Your prescription order, You agree to address this issue with the
                Enrolled Pharmacy directly.</p>
            <p>You also acknowledge and agree that we do not provide any medical advice, opinion, diagnosis
                or treatment, and that that no pharmacy-patient relationship or doctor-patient relationship is, or
                will be, established between KOW and You as a result of Your use of the Services or otherwise.
                It is imperative that You check product information (including package inserts) regarding
                dosages, precautions, warnings, interactions and contraindications before administering or using
                any medications. If You have any questions regarding Your prescriptions, You should consult
                Your healthcare professional or pharmacist, whose contact information may be listed on the
                prescription or the packaging of Your prescription medicine. KOW cannot and will not answer
                any inquiries regarding the aforementioned.</p>
            <h3>IF YOU ARE HAVING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES –
                CALL 911.</h3>
            <h3>Using Our Services</h3>
            <p>If You access or use the Services on behalf of a company, principal, patient, or other entity, You
                represent, warrant, covenant, and agree that You have authority to bind such entity and its
                affiliates to the Agreement and that it is fully binding upon them. KOW is relying on the veracity
                of the directly preceding sentence. In such case, the term “You” will refer to You, as an
                individual or to each such entity and its affiliates on whose behalf You are accessing or using the
                Services. If You do not have authority, or if You do not agree with the terms of the Agreement,
                You shall not access or use the Services and further should immediately exit any existing access
                to the Services. You should read and keep a copy of each component of the Agreement for Your
                records. In the event of a conflict among them, the terms of this document will control and be
                binding.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>KOW reserves the right to modify or revise the Agreement, including without limitation this
                Terms of Use, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion without notice to You. Your use of
                the Services will constitute Your acceptance of and agreement to such changes. IF YOU DO
                NOT WISH TO BE BOUND TO THE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
            <h3>SMS Text Messaging</h3>
            <p>By using our Services, You are agreeing to be contacted by us via SMS Text Messaging. By
                using our Services, You authorize us and our partners and service providers to use auto-dialer
                and non-auto-dialer technology to send text messages to the mobile phone number associated
                with Your opt-in (i.e., the mobile device phone number You provided when submitting Your
                Request). You confirm that You are the subscriber to the relevant phone number or that You are
                the customary user of that number on a family or business plan and that You are authorized to 
                opt in. By using our Services, You agree to the standard message and data rates that may apply
                and that You may be charged the same in connection with Your use of the Services. You further
                release us from any and all liability associated with SMS Text Messaging including but not
                limited to any potential interception of the SMS Text Messages whether by bad actors, poor or
                unsecured wi-fi encryption, security and the like.</p>
            <h3>Mobile Security</h3>
            <p>Most communication with the Company occurs through Your mobile device, computer, laptop,
                tablet, or other similar device (“Devices”). Therefore, Your Devices likely contain Protected
                Health Information (“PHI”), such as pictures of Your prescriptions, medical insurance cards, and
                other vulnerable information. As a result, it is of the utmost importance that You keep Your
                Devices secure at all times. If You are using public Wi-Fi or email applications on Your Devices,
                You are likely using unsecure networks, putting PHI at risk of interception.
                The best ways to protect Devices from security breaches is to maintain password protection, 2
                Factor Authentication, encryption, and/or to install a remote wiping/disabling program into them.
                Remote wiping/disabling program allows users to quickly clear and disable a lost or stolen
                mobile device, which can possibly prevent or reduce the magnitude of the breach.
                While KOW takes the utmost care in protecting Your confidential information, it cannot protect
                information stored in Your Devices. By using KOW, You agree to indemnify and hold KOW
                harmless for all loss, damage, claims, or legal actions resulting from any data breaches occurring
                from theft/misplacement or any third-party intervention with any and all of Your Devices.</p>
            <h3>Third-Party API</h3>
            <p>By using the Services, You agree with our use of a third party application programming interface
                company (“API”) with which the KOW server will interact to submit Your Request to the
                Enrolled Pharmacies and connect You to the Requested Medication. Services provided by the
                Third-Party API are incorporated without limitation in the KOW Services, as defined above and
                hereinafter. By utilizing the Services You consent to and agree to be bound by, to the extent
                applicable, the Third-Party API provider’s terms and conditions of service to the extent the same
                are not in conflict with this Agreement.</p>
            <h3>Proprietary Rights and License</h3>
            <p>KOW, its affiliates, and licensors, if any, exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the
                Services, including all associated intellectual property rights (hereinafter, the “KOW Brand
                Features”). You acknowledge that the Services and KOW Brand Features are protected by the

                the Services. Neither these Terms nor Your use of the Services transfers any right, title or interest
                in the Services, or intellectual property rights to You, and KOW and its third-party licensors, if
                any, retain all respective right, title, and interest to the Services.</p>
            <h3>Rights Granted by KOW</h3>
            <p>Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement and any other agreements that may be entered
                into between the parties, KOW grants You a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable

                OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BELOW,
                AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU AGREE

                INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND THAT YOU ARE HEREBY WAIVING YOUR RIGHT
                TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
                ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New
                York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
            <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
            <p>You and KOW agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
                Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the
                Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party
                retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive
                or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
                infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
                patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an
                “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, You will also have the right to
                litigate any other Dispute if You provide KOW with written notice of Your desire to do so by
                email at legal@KOWmeds.com within thirty (30) days following the date You first accept these
                Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”) and KOW agrees. If You don’t provide
                KOW with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, You will be deemed
                to have knowingly and intentionally waived Your right to litigate any Dispute except as
                expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP
                Protection Action or, if You timely provide KOW with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the
                state and federal courts located in the state of New York and each of the parties hereto waives
                any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless You timely provide KOW with an
                Arbitration Opt-out Notice, You acknowledge and agree that You and KOW are each waiving
                the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
                action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both You and KOW otherwise agree in
                writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise
                preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held

            <h3>Arbitration Rules</h3>
            <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
                accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
                Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this
                “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the

                enforcement of this Section.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
            <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for
                Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
                www.adr.org.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law
                and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable
                to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then
                the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
            <p>Unless You and KOW otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the New York
                County. If Your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on
                the basis of the documents that You and KOW submit to the arbitrator, unless You request a
                hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If Your claim exceeds $10,000,
                Your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the
                arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties,
                consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
            <h3>Arbitrator’s Decision</h3>
            <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The
                arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator
                based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
                “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party
                may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
                claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual
                claim. KOW will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
